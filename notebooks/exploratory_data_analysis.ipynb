    "Contract Advisor RAG: Towards Building A High-Precision Legal Expert LLM APP\n",
    "Business objective  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lizzy AI is an early-stage Israeli startup, developing the next-generation contract AI (see short video). We leverage Hybrid LLM technology (edge, private cloud and LLM services), to build the first, fully autonomous, artificial contract lawyer. The first step in our journey is a powerful contract assistant, with the ultimate goal of developing a fully autonomous contract bot, capable of drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts, independently, end-to-end, without human assistance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is as follows:  build, evaluate and improve a RAG system for Contract Q&A (chatting with a contract and asking questions about the contract). \n",
    "Background Context\n",
    "\n",
    "What is RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation, commonly known as RAG, is a hybrid AI model that marries the expertise of powerful language models with the richness of external data sources. At its core, RAG leverages a large language model for generating responses, but with a twist – it first retrieves relevant information from a vast pool of external data. This retrieval phase empowers the model to augment its generated responses with information that goes beyond its initial training data, offering more accurate, informed, and context-rich outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is RAG Exciting: Building a basic RAG system can be surprisingly straightforward, making it an enticing entry point for AI enthusiasts and students. However, crafting a high-quality, robust RAG system that performs exceptionally well is a complex and challenging endeavor. This complexity provides a rich learning ground for those aspiring to push the boundaries in AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG Opportunities: As AI continues to evolve, the demand for models that can intelligently and dynamically interact with vast pools of information is skyrocketing. RAG sits at this juncture, proving its value in numerous applications - from enhancing search engines to powering sophisticated chatbots and decision-support systems. The industry is on a constant lookout for professionals who can innovate and improve RAG systems. Given its vast potential and applicability, experts in RAG are poised to be highly sought after in the AI industry. The ability to design, implement, and refine RAG systems aligns with the industry's need for AI solutions that are both knowledgeable and contextually aware, making RAG expertise a valuable and future-proof skill.\n",
