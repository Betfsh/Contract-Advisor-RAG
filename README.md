## Project overview

The project goal is to develop an advanced contract AI system for a startup company, creating the first fully autonomous artificial contract lawyer. Using Hybrid LLM technology, the project focuses on building, evaluating, and enhancing a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system for Contract Q&A. This involves marrying powerful language models with external data sources to provide accurate and context-rich responses. The project includes researching RAG system improvements, building a Q&A pipeline, establishing a RAG evaluation pipeline,optimizing Contract Q&A, and implementing enhancements. Ultimately, it aims to revolutionize the legal industry with an autonomous contract assistant capable of independent contract drafting, review, and negotiation.
